    "body": "Many storage cards do not provide feedback on a write command, and it is a surprisingly common case for systems to follow a write command with a read, to check if the card actually has written the data on the storage card. For example, this is a mandatory step for the implementation of the norm [NF P99-410](https://www.boutique.afnor.org/fr-fr/norme/nf-p99410/billettique-appliquee-aux-transports-regles-dinteroperabilite-pour-la-codif/fa183701/42996) (most commonly known as Intertic) in France.\n\nCould it be possible to add a `preparedVerifiedWriteBlocks` interface to the StorageCardTransactionManager, that would do this `write -> read -> ensure written properly` flow when a processCommand is requested? This would avoid the applicative layer to have to keep track of the changes it is trying to do and do these checks manually, making the StorageCardTransactionManager better suited for these kind of work flows.",
