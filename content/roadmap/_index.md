## current work and future developments

 - extension of the Calypso API to add support for Prime Extended and Prime PKI transaction modes
   - ciphered card commands/responses, and intermediate mutual authentication inside a secure session
   - asymmetric card authentication without a SAM
 - refactoring of the Calypso API to integrate different Calypso SAM solutions (legacy SAM & Open SAM)
   - split of the Calypso API to separate card operations in a Calypso Card API independently to the SAM solution
   - Calypso Legacy SAM API to support all transaction modes of the legacy SAM C1.
 - Reader API & Card API refactoring for the setting of a card selection
   - moving of some elements of card DF selector from the Card API to the Reader API â†’ This will simplify the Card API, and will allow the implementation of the ISO selection settings to be factorised independently of the card extensions.
