As part of the **Reader Layer**, the **Calypsonet Terminal Card API** defines the internal elements shared by the 
reader layer to implement specific card layers (like the Calypso Card layer).

## Limitations & constraints

The **Card API** doesn't allow to request the transmission to a card of the APDU commands "Select Application by DF Name"
or "Get Response":
- the selection of a specific card application could be managed only through a Card Selection Request.
- the APDU response status words 61XYh & 6CXYh are automatically handled by the reader layer library by issuing a
  Get Response or by re-issuing the previous command with the expected 'Le' field.
