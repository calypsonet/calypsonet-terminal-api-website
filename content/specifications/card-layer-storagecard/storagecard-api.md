As part of the **Card Layer**, the **Storage Card API** provides high-level functionality for selecting and performing 
transactions with storage cards (NXP Mifare Ultralight, ST Microelectronics ST25 / SRT512, etc.).

<br>

## Interfaces

The **Storage Card API** provides the means to select a target card and then perform a transaction with the selected card.
- The result of a card selection is a storage card image whose UID and data blocks can be browsed.

The `StorageCard` interface provide **accessors** to recover the information of the selected storage card.

To optimize the number of exchanges with a card reader, the **Storage Card API** allows grouping the commands.
A set of commands could be first **prepared**, and then be **processed** by a selected target at the selection or
during the transaction.
A transaction with a storage card is fully managed through the `StorageCardTransactionManager` interface:
