To ensure the proper working and interoperability of ticketing terminal solutions, [CNA](https://calypsonet.org/) has also defined [rules that shall be followed by terminal solutions](https://calypsonet.org/calypso-for-terminals/#section-how-to-implement-calypso-in-a-ticketing-terminal) for different software layers. From the lowest to the highest level:
- the [Reader Layer Requirements](https://calypsonet.org/reader-layer-requirements-200422/),
- the [Calypso Layer Requirements](https://calypsonet.org/calypso-layer-requirements-200423/),
- and the [Ticketing Layer Requirements](https://calypsonet.org/ticketing-layer-requirements-200430/).

The layout of the ticketing terminal APIs matches the architecture targeted by the ticketing terminal requirements.
It should therefore be possible in the future to certify the compliance with the terminal requirements for ticketing terminal solutions based on these APIs.
