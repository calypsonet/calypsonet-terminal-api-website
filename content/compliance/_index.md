## Ticketing Terminal Requirements
To counteract the interoperability issues frequently encountered between ticketing terminal solutions and contactless smartcard products, [CNA](https://calypsonet.org/) has specified a set of requirements that need to be followed by the different software layers of ticketing terminals.
These rules are specifically dedicated to 3 software layers, from the lowest to the highest level:
- the [Reader Layer Requirements](https://calypsonet.org/reader-layer-requirements-200422/),
- the [Calypso Layer Requirements](https://calypsonet.org/calypso-layer-requirements-200423/),
- and the [Ticketing Layer Requirements](https://calypsonet.org/ticketing-layer-requirements-200430/).

The structure of the ticketing terminal APIs has been designed to match this architecture targeted by the ticketing terminal requirements.

In the near future, CNA plans to offer a certification program for ticketing terminal solutions to validate compliance with requirements for the reader layer and the Calypso layer. â†’ The support of the Ticketing Terminal APIs will then be required to pass these certifications.

## APIs compatibility with Terminal Requirements

### From Reader API version 2.0 & Calypso Card API version 2.0
The ticketing terminal APIs enable the implementation of libraries that unconditionally fully comply with the ticketing terminal requirements of the reader and Calypso layers.

### Up to Reader API version 1.3 & Calypso Card API version 1.8
The older ticketing terminal APIs can be implemented by libraries that can "generally" follow the terminal requirements of the reader and Calypso layers, but with a limitation on the localization of the card selection management.
<br>On early versions of the Reader and Calypso APIs, the card selection was managed through the Calypso API instead of the Reader API.

## Implementation compliance
CNA offers a [guide to assist declarations of compliance](https://keyple-support.calypsonet.org/basics/compliance/) with terminal requirements for solutions based on [Eclipse Keyple](https://keyple.org/) libraries.
