To improve the interoperability of the ticketing terminals, the [Calypso Networks Association](https://calypsonet.org/calypso-for-terminals/#section-how-to-implement-calypso-in-a-ticketing-terminal)<br>
has specified rules to be supported by terminal solutions:
- the [Reader Layer Requirements](https://calypsonet.org/reader-layer-requirements-200422/),
- and the [Calypso Layer Requirements](https://calypsonet.org/calypso-layer-requirements-200423/).

Three terminal APIs have been defined for terminal implementations in order to certify the compliance with these rules:
- the **Reader API**, the **Card API**,
- and the **Calypso API**s.
