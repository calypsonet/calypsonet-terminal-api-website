## Current work and future developments

For 2025, addition of an interface dedicated to the management of the new Calypso "OpenSAM" secure module.
 - No impact on the secure card transaction thanks to the abstraction provided by the Calypso Symmetric Crypto interface.
 - OpenSAM selection and personalization functions.
