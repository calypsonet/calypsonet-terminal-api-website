There are two types of Keyple components: APIs and libraries. Some APIs are provided by Calypso Networks Association. APIs contain only interfaces. Libraries contain interfaces and their implementation. Some APIs are public while others are internal. All libraries are public. All libraries and public APIs can be used by the developer of the client application. The internal APIs are intended for the developer of Keyple add-ons only (e.g. custom reader plugin, custom card extension or custom distributed solution).
