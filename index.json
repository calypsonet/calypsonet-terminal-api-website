[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Definition of Calypso layer APIs The Calypso Networks Association is responsible for specifying, qualifying and promoting the Calypso ticketing standard. Contributions to the definition of Calypso APIs for ticketing terminals are therefore reserved for CNA members participating in the “TC Terminal” technical working group.\nRegistered members have access to a document database and a discussion forum to exchange ideas, propose and agree on solutions for the design of interoperable Calypso ticketing terminals. These collaborations have, for example, led to the specification of requirements for the Calypso layer of ticketing terminals. Compliance with these requirements by ticketing terminal solutions ensures interoperability with all Calypso card and SAM products. Calypso APIs for ticketing terminals:\nenable the implementation of libraries that meet the requirements of the Calypso layer, provide a solution for developing ticketing applications for terminals independently of Calypso middleware solutions, will soon enable Calypso terminal solutions to certify compliance with Calypso layer requirements. Join CNA to contribute to defining Calypso APIs for ticketing terminals.\nDefinition of Reader layer APIs An interoperable Calypso software layer can only be built on a generic reader software layer interface, independent of card reader solutions and ticketing terminal architecture (embedded/distributed). CNA is not necessarily legitimate in defining such “universal” terminal interfaces for the smart card industry but has initiated these definitions in response to the need for a basis on which to build Calypso APIs.\nFor the definition of the reader APIs for ticketing terminals, CNA is interested in the participation of any external contributor and is also open to sharing the governance of this project with other entities or the open-source community. (CNA offered the Smart Ticketing Alliance to host this project. Another option currently under consideration is to transfer this responsibility to the Eclipse Keypop open-source project.)\nTypes of contributions Thanks for your interest in participating in the reader layer APIs definition for a ticketing terminal. There are several ways to contribute to the project:\nPropose a fix for a problem that is already known or that you have identified. In this case you will have to notify the issue in the repository where the problem appeared and reference the issue in all the other repositories affected by the fix. Propose the creation of a new component: in this case you will first have to create an issue in the repository github.com/calypsonet/calypsonet-terminal-api-website to justify the need and request the creation of a new repository, wait for the issue to be resolved by the decision of the committers, and then create an issue in the new repository signifying the start of development of the new component. Contributing via fork Check if there is already a GitHub issue for what you want to work on or create one. Announce in the comments section that you want to work on the issue. Also describe the solution you want to implement. To improve the chances for your contribution to be accepted, you’ll want to wait for the feedback of the committers. Fork the repository. Create a new branch from main for your changes. Name it after the issue number, e.g. #XXX_[description_of_changes]. Implement your changes. Rebase on main. Run ./gradlew spotlessApply to format the code and add licence headers to the files. Run ./gradlew build (to check code formatting and run tests) Commit your changes using the -s flag in order to add a Signed-off-by footer as mentioned above and use the same email address you are using for your GitHub account.\nUse commits messages that respect the commits message conventions. Push your changes to your forked repository. Submit a pull request referencing the related issue(s). After submitting, do not use your branch for any other development, otherwise further changes that you make will be visible in the PR. Commits message conventions In order to ensure good readability of the commit history, it is necessary to have consistency in the structure of the commit messages.\nTherefore, all contributors to the project are asked to respect the structure of the commits messages as described in the guide Conventional Commits 1.0.0:\n\u0026lt;type\u0026gt;[optional scope]: \u0026lt;description\u0026gt; [optional body] \u0026lt;footer(s)\u0026gt; Furthermore, it is requested to indicate in the footer section the associated issue(s) that will be closed (Closes #xxx, closes #yyy, etc...). This will automatically close the associated issue(s) when the pull request is validated (see GitHub Docs for more details).\nIt is also required to indicate possible references to other associated issues (Refs: #aaa, #bbbb, repository_owner/other_repository_name#ccc, etc...).\nHere is fictive example:\nfeat(observation): allow asynchronous notification of reader events Add a public method in the observable reader to enable asynchronous …","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1725427750,"objectID":"03b6ed671df847a7fe95d07d922cdb1a","permalink":"https://terminal-api.calypsonet.org/community/contributing/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/community/contributing/","section":"community","summary":"Find out how to contribute to the Calypso Networks Terminal API project and how it can benefit your organization.","tags":null,"title":"How to contribute","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Current work and future developments For 2025, addition of an interface dedicated to the management of the new Calypso “OpenSAM” secure module.\nNo impact on the secure card transaction thanks to the abstraction provided by the Calypso Symmetric Crypto interface.

A transaction with a target card may involve a control SAM in order to secure the operations. The CalypsoCard interfaces provide accessors in order to recover the information of the selected smart card.\nTo optimize the number of exchanges with a card reader, the Calypso Card API allows to group the commands. A set of command could be first prepared, and then be processed by a selected target at the selection or during the transaction. A transaction with a Calypso card is fully managed through the CardTransactionManager interface:\nSelection of a Calypso card A Calypso card selection could be defined to accept or not invalidated card.\nThrough the selection only basic Select File (without changing DF) or Read Records commands could joined: the goal is to recover in the selection result some file status or record data of elements present in all cards of a ticketing networks. The type of card product has not yet been identified, the commands are prepared to be supported by all types of card products: Prime, Light, or Regular.\nThen, if a Calypso card has matched the selection request, a Calypso card image is returned, some file headers or file records could be filled depending on the information recovered in the responses of the Select File or Read Records processed.\nTransaction with a Calypso card Except the operations involving secure processing on “data” (data signature computation / verification, data ciphering / un-ciphering), only commands for the card need to be prepared though the Card Transaction Manager interface. Depending on the operation, if necessary the security involving the master SAM must be controlled internally by the Calypso library.\nSimple operation outside a session PIN plain verification / change outside a session Calypso Card API - Verify / Change Plain PIN - Sequence Diagram Data secure processing outside a session Calypso Card API - Data secure processing outside a session - Sequence Diagram Key / PIN ciphered update outside a session Calypso Card API - Change Key / Ciphered PIN outside a session - Sequence Diagram Stored Value operation outside a session Calypso Card API - standalone Stored Value transaction - Sequence Diagram Simple secure session for fast embedded performance This example illustrates the ticketing processing of a validation: only the necessary data is read from the card.\nIn case of communication failure with the card, to support a recovery transaction on another terminal: the ratification status and the last event are checked at the session opening, and the session is closed as not ratified directly followed by a ratification command.\nCalypso Card API - Simple Secure Session - Sequence Diagram Simple secure session for an efficient distributed system In most of the cases, it should be possible to handle a secure session with a Calypso card, using only:\n3 exchanges with the card reader (selection processing, session opening processing, and session closing processing), and 3 exchanges with the SAM reader (terminal session challenge recovery, session MAC computation, and card authentication). This example shows the loading of a contract during a sale, to speed up the identification of the card content while limiting the exchange of messages with the card reader, some data can be read out of session during the selection, then read again during the session.\nIn case of communication failure with the card, if the recovery transaction is supported only on the same terminal, then the checking of the ratification status is not necessary at the session opening, and the session could be closed as ratified.\nCalypso Card API - Simple Secure Session - Sequence Diagram PIN ciphered verification inside a session Calypso Card API - Verify Ciphered PIN inside a session - Sequence Diagram Data secure processing inside a session Calypso Card API - Data secure processing inside a session - Sequence Diagram Stored Value operation inside a session Calypso Card API - Stored Value transaction inside a secure session - Sequence Diagram Multiple secure sessions Calypso Card API - Multiple secure session - Sequence Diagram ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1714981342,"objectID":"6ad7cc20aaf4cc03812350271d69b202","permalink":"https://terminal-api.calypsonet.org/specifications/calypso-layer/calypso-card-api/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/specifications/calypso-layer/calypso-card-api/","section":"specifications","summary":"Public high-level API which standardizes the way to interact with a Calypso® product (card, NFC smartphone applet/application, SAM, etc...).","tags":null,"title":"Calypso Card API (external)","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Latest version 2.0.1 UML class diagram GitHub repository As part of the Reader Layer, the Reader API provides high-level functionality for identifying, monitoring, configuring readers and process card selection scenarios.\nInterfaces The Reader API is a high-level interface used by terminal applications to operate smart card readers, it:\nprovides the means to identify card readers and verify the presence of smart cards.\noffers the possibility to configure the observation of readers in order to be notified on card insertion or withdrawal.\nis the entry point to manage the selection of a smart card in a specific reader.\nReader identification Any smart card reader entity should be accessible through an implementation of the CardReader interface.

Finally, this interface can inform about the presence of a card in the reader.\nConfigurableCardReader A reader with the capability to configure the communication protocols with smart card (contactless or contact) could implement the ConfigurableCardReader interface to activate or deactivate some communication protocols.\nReader observation If a reader has the ability to dynamically detect changes on the card presence, then it can also implement the interface ObservableCardReader.\nObservers implementing the CardReaderObserverSpi could be declared to an observable card reader to be notified on specific CardReaderEvent: card insertion, card selection (matched), or card removal.\nCard Selection The CardSelectionManager provides the possibility to prepare a request that could contain one or several card application selections.\nThe CardSelection SPI interface could be extended by the API of a specific smart card solution to improve the selection request with settings specific to the smart card solution.\nThrough the card selection manager, the prepared card selections could be managed in\nsynchronously: processed directly on a specific card reader on which a card is already present,\nor asynchronously: scheduled on a specific observable reader in order to be operated dynamically in case of card insertion detection.\nIf several card selections are prepared, the card selection manager operate the card selection in the order of preparation. By default, the card selection manager stops the card selection processing on the first successful card selection, and the logical channel is kept open.\nIn case the multiple selection mode is activated during the preparation, the card selection manager tries to operate ‘all’ the prepared selections, even if one or several of them are successful. If the last selection is successful, the logical channel could be kept open with the last selected application.\nduring the card selection preparation, it could also be explicitly requested to close the logical channel after the card selection.\nMoreover, it is possible to export/import a selection scenario in JSON format.\nCard selection modes Depending on the card transaction use case, or on the reader capability, there are two ways to manage the selection of a card:\nEither synchronously on a simple reader, a selection could be operated directly by transmitting the card selection scenario. In this case the same entity manages both the card selection and the card processing. Otherwise asynchronously on an observable reader, a scheduled card selection could be defined. In this case the card selection is operated automatically at the insertion of the card. In this case, the card selection is next managed by the observable reader, but the card processing is managed by a reader observer. Reader API - Card Selection Modes - Activity Diagram Observable reader states An observable reader is active only when at least one reader observer is registered, and if the start of the detection has been requested. When active, an observable reader could switch between three internal states:\nWait for card insertion Wait for card processing Wait for card removal In the nominal case, a reader observer indicates to the observable reader that the processing of the card is finished by releasing the card channel. To manage a failure of the reader observer process, the observable reader interface provides also a method to finalize the card processing.\nReader API - Observable Reader States - Activity Diagram The states could be switched:\ndue to an explicit API request (blue arrows): the release of the card channel, the call of an observable reader method: the addition or the remove of an observable reader, a request to start or stop the detection, to finalize the card processing.
